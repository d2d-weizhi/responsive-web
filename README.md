# Responsive Web Design | Deep-dive & Tinkering
I suppose it is high-time that I took a moment just to focus purely on responsive web design.

## Overview

In early 2006, I started believing in the importance of creating websites that are more responsive. Since then I have been practicing the art of creating websites that don't just provide a good UX in a desktop browser, but also in mobile web browsers.

Between learning about what responsive design is, versus actually practicing it, I've chosen to spent most of my energy on experimenting and tinkering with what works best. So far, my experience when it comes to creating responsive web designs have been mostly hands-on.

But I also recognize that there were certain concepts and ideas that I might've missed out on when I'm always sticking to the most familiar and common applications. My hope of doing this deep-dive learning & tinkering is that I might discover things that I'm not aware of before.
